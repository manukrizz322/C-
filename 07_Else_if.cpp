Else If Ladder in C++ :

A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions:

1. Hardness must be greater than 50.
2. Carbon content must be less than 0.7
3. Tensile strength must be greater than 5600

The grades are as follows:

Grade is 10, if all three conditions are met.
Grade is 9, if conditions 1 and 2 are met.
Grade is 8, if conditions 2 and 3 are met.
Grade is 7, if conditions 1 and 3 are met.
Grade is 6, if only one condition is met.
Grade is 5, if none of the conditions are met.
